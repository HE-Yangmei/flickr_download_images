# flickr_download_images
Downloads a set of images from flickr given categories of tags. 

Uses this flickr api kit https://stuvel.eu/flickrapi and Python 3

Edit the text files with tags (one per line).

You can change the name of the text files to be the actual name of your category.

You'll also need to edit the three variables at the top of flick.py to suit your needs.

Don't forget to change the api_key and api_secret to your keys! (These needed to be requested from flickr)
